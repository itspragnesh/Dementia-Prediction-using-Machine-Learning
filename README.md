# Dementia-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict dementia using clinical and MRI data. The dataset included features such as Subject ID, MRI ID, Group (Demented/Non-demented), Age, Gender, Handedness, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and brain volume measurements like eTIV and nWBV.

I applied several algorithms, including KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree to predict dementia. After comparing model performance, the highest accuracy achieved was 96%
